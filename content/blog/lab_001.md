Code should exist as a living, typed graph rather than fragile text.

Mutations operate on a schema-validated IR (canonical JSON, Cap’n Proto, Lumata-style, etc.), guaranteeing syntactic and type correctness before testing.

Every IR node lives in an immutable, content-addressed graph store (à la IPFS or Datomic), making branching, diffing, and merging cheap and lock-free for massive parallel search.

Candidates are represented in static single-assignment / MLIR-like form, so control- and data-flow facts persist across generations and analyses become incremental updates.

A hot, incremental JIT or partial evaluator consumes the unchanged IR, eliminating full rebuilds and shifting compute toward discovering improvements.

The schema-first IR embeds proof terms and refinement types, turning formal verification into an intrinsic, always-on property of the artefact.

The substrate exposes hooks for a language-model agent to evaluate expressions inside the repo, enabling in-place reasoning within the evolving codebase.

Together these features remove parse/compile overhead, collapse incidental complexity, and expand effective search bandwidth for evolutionary program synthesis.
